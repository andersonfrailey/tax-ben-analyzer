About OSPC
==========

The Open Source Policy Center (OSPC) is making policy analysis
more transparent, trustworthy, and collaborative by supporting
open source projects that build cutting-edge models.

Background
----------

Policymakers increasingly rely on computer-driven models to predict
the budgetary and broader economic impacts of current and proposed
policies, especially those involving taxes and entitlements. Estimates
from these models often determine a bill's success or failure in the
legislative process and public sphere.

Projects
--------

The Open Source Policy Center's first focus is supporting 
community-driven projects that analyze the budgetary and
broader economic impact of taxes. These models are completely
transparent and freely available to researchers across the
country. OSPC also provides an easy-to-use online interface that allows
students, policymakers, journalists, and informed citizens to interact
with the models and learn for themselves about the effects of
policies.
