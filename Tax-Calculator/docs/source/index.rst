Tax-Calculator 
==============

The Tax-Calculator simulates the US federal individual income tax
system.  In conjunction with micro data that represent the US
population and a set of behavioral assumptions, the Tax-Calculator can
be used to conduct revenue scoring and distributional analyses of tax
policies.  The Tax-Calculator is written in Python, an interpreted
language that can execute on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
