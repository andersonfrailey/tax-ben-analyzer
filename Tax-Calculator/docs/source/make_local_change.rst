Making changes to your local copy of the Tax-Calculator
=======================================================

This document provides examples of two different kinds of changes to
your local copy of the Tax-Calculator.  The first example illustrates
changing the numerical value of a tax parameter that already exists in
the Tax-Calculator code.  The second example illustrates adding a new
tax parameter and its associated logic that do not already exist in
the Tax-Calculator.

Example 1: Changing the value of an existing tax parameter
----------------------------------------------------------

In this example, we make a simple change in the file that stores the
Tax-Calculator's tax parameters. The process we outline below is
similar to the steps you'll take when you make changes in your own
local tax-calculator directory.

**1. Navigate to the relevant file and open it.**

From your tax-calculator directory, the path to the file that defines
the tax parameters is:

.. code-block:: python

   tax-calculator/taxcalc/current_law_policy.json

**2. Identify the desired change.**

Users may not be familiar with the acronyms AMTI and AMT used in the
description of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) exemption amount
parameter. We want to include their full names in addition to the
acronyms in the description that is highlighted below.

.. image:: images/make_local_change_eg1_1.png

**3. Make the change and save.**

We add the written-out forms of AMTI and AMT and save the changes. The
new code looks like this:

.. image:: images/make_local_change_eg1_2.png

**4. Test and save your parameter change.**

For details on how to test and save your changes, return to the
:doc:`Contributor Guide </contributor_guide>` and continue with Step 4
of the Workflow section.

Example 2: Adding a new tax parameter and associated logic
----------------------------------------------------------

Some changes to the Tax-Calculator require edits to the code in more
than one place and in more than one file. In this example, we show how
to add a tax parameter --- a floor rate for the charitable deduction
--- to the calculator.

**1. Open the tax parameters file.**

We define tax parameters in current_law_policy.json; all of the tax parameters
that are already part of the Tax-Calculator (for example, the personal
income tax rates, the additional child tax credit rate, and the
deduction for medical expenses rate) are in that file. The file
current_law_policy.json is your starting point.

From your tax-calculator directory, the path to current_law_policy.json is:

.. code-block:: python

   tax-calculator/taxcalc/current_law_policy.json

**2. Add the new parameter.**

The following code outlines the syntax and requirements for adding a
new itemized deduction parameter in current_law_policy.json. This code uses
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). You don't need to be familiar with
JSON to perform this task - just copy the following code, paste it
anywhere in current_law_policy.json [1]_, and fill out the relevant information
between the each pair of asterisks.

.. code-block:: python

   "_ID_*Name*_*parametertype*":{
     "long_name": "Itemized Deduction: *Full deduction name* (*parameter type description*)",
     "description": "*A short description of the deduction.*",
     "irs_ref": "Form *IRS form number*, line *IRS line number*, ",
     "notes": "*Relevant comments or links to clarify the deduction.*",
     "start_year": *Four-digit year for when the deduction first becomes part of the tax code*,
     "col_var": "*Name of the value's column variable if applicable*",
     "row_var": "FLPDYR", #1
     "row_label": ["2013"], #2
     "cpi_inflated": Boolean *true* if the deduction is annually adjusted for inflation or boolean *false*,
     "col_label": ["*Labels of the value's columns if applicable*"],
     "value":     [*The parameter's value(s)*]
   },

Treat the strings at points #1 and #2 as given. The completed code for
the charitable deduction floor rate looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

   "_ID_Charity_frt":{
     "long_name": "Itemized Deduction: Charitable Deduction Floor (%, floor)",
     "description": "You are eligible to deduct your charitable expense when it exceeds this percentage of AGI.",
     "irs_ref": "Form , line , ",
     "notes": "This parameter allows for implementation of Option 52 from https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/49638-BudgetOptions.pdf.",
     "start_year": 2013,
     "col_var": "",
     "row_var": "FLPDYR",
     "row_label": ["2013"],
     "cpi_inflated": false,
     "col_label": "",
     "value":     [0.0]
   },

The new parameter's name consists of _ID (for Itemized Deduction), the
deduction's name (_Charity), and the parameter's type (_frt for floor
rate). For other parameter name and type abbreviations, see
:doc:`parameter naming and placing conventions</parameter_naming>`.

The parameter has several attributes; the first year that we have a
value for is 2013 and it is not adjusted for inflation. The charitable
deduction floor rate is zero, because this parameter doesn't exist in
the current tax code - so, as of 2013, you are eligible to deduct your
eligible charitable expense when it exceeds 0% of your Adjusted Gross
Income.

We leave blank the attributes "irs_ref", "col_var", and "col_label" as
there is no reference to our new parameter in the IRS forms and there
is only one column in the "value" attribute.

**3. Open the functions file.**

Now that we've defined the new parameter in current_law_policy.json, we need to
tell the Tax-Calculator to take into account that new parameter when
it calculates taxes. The calculator's functions that model tax logic
and work with the tax parameters are in the file functions.py.
Starting from your tax-calculator directory, the path to functions.py
is:

.. code-block:: python

   tax-calculator/taxcalc/functions.py

**4. Tell the calculator to perform the relevant function on the new
tax parameter.**

Find the function that works with the charitable deduction in
functions.py by using `this spreadsheet`_ which documents the core
data variables. First, search for the word charity and identify the
core variables that handle charity data: E19700, E19800, E20100, and
E20200. Second, search for the *numerical* portions of those variable
names in functions.py and identify the function where they appear:
ItemDed() (if you're unfamiliar with Python, identify a function by
the syntax "def FunctionName()"). The function ItemDed() calculates
the total itemized deduction amount.

We add the parameter name that we defined in current_law_policy.json to *both* the
ItemDed() function and the @iterate_jit() decorator that is located
above that function. There are several things to note when you do
this:

   * Surround the parameter name with quotes in @iterate_jit(). Do not
     surround the parameter name with quotes in def ItemDed().

   * If the word "puf" appears the argument list of def ItemDed() make
     sure it comes last.

   * Parameter names in current_law_policy.json begin with an underscore. Do not
     include that underscore in functions.py; _ID_Charity_frt in
     current_law_policy.json becomes ID_Charity_frt in functions.py.

**5. Add the relevant code to the function.**

In step 4, we told the Tax-Calculator the name of our new tax
parameter. In this step, we add code to the function ItemDed() to
calculate the charitable deduction amount using the new charitable
deduction floor rate.

We add the following code under the "Charity" subheading inside ItemDed():

.. image:: images/make_local_change_eg2_2.png

The first line of the highlighted code calculates the amount of
charitable expense that an individual must exceed to claim the
charitable deduction by multiplying the floor rate that we defined in
current_law_policy.json with positive Adjusted Gross Income. The second line sets
the total charitable deduction amount to zero or, if greater than
zero, to the individual's total charitable expenses minus the
charity_floor variable.

**6. Test and save your code changes.**

with the Tax-Calculator team, return to the :doc:`Contributor Guide
</contributor_guide>` and continue with Step 4 of the Workflow
section.

       particular order. This undefined layout is likely to change in
       the future as we move to organize the file.
