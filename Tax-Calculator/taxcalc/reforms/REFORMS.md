# HOW TO SPECIFY A TAX REFORM IN A REFORM FILE

A tax reform consists of a series of reform provisions.  There is a
way to specify in a text file the collection of reform provisions that
make up a reform proposal.  When stored on your local computer, such
reform files can be used to estimate reform effects either by
uploading to the [TaxBrain webapp](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/)
or by using the `--reform` option to the `tc.py` command-line
interface to Tax-Calculator.

Here we provide links to several reform files that specify historical
reform proposals, and then provide a more general explanation of the
structure and syntax of reform files.

## Historical Tax Reforms

The following reform proposals have been specified in reforms files:

- [2016 Trump Campaign Tax Plan](Trump2016.json)

- [2016 Clinton Campaign Tax Plan](Clinton2016.json)

- [2016 Ryan-Brady "Better Way" Tax Plan](RyanBrady.json)

## Structure and Syntax of Reform Files

The reform files are JSON files.  JSON, which stands for JavaScript
Object Notation, is an easy way to specify structured information that
is widely used.  First we provide an abstract example of a JSON reform
file with some explanation, and then we provide links to a few
hypothetical reform files that illustrate their expressive range.

Here is an abstract example of a tax reform proposal that consists of
several reform provisions.  The structure of this file is as follows:

```
{
  "policy": {
     <parameter_name>: {<calyear>: <parameter-value>,
                        ...,
                        <calyear>: <parameter-value>},
     <parameter_name>: {<calyear>: <parameter-value>},
     ...,
     <parameter_name>: {<calyear>: <parameter-value>,
                        ...,
                        <calyear>: <parameter-value>}
  }
}
```

Notice each pair of reform provision is separated by commas.
Each reform provision may have one or multiple year-value pairs.
Also, the <parameter_name> and <calyear> must be enclosed in quotes (").
The <parameter_value> is enclosed in single brackets when
the <parameter_value> is a scalar and enclosed in double brackets when
the <parameter_value> is a vector.  The most common vector of values
is one that varies by filing status (MARS) with the vector containing
six parameter values for single, married filing joint, married filing
separate, head of household, widow, separate.

The following hypothetical payroll tax reforms illustrate the
flexibility that reform files provide in expressing complex tax
reforms.  Note that the current-law values of each tax parameter
are shown in [this JSON file](../current_law_policy.json).

[Raise OASDI and HI payroll tax rates](ptaxes0.json)

[Raise OASDI maximum taxable earnings](ptaxes1.json)

[Eliminate OASDI maximum taxable earnings](ptaxes2.json)

[Raise Additional Medicare Tax (Form 8959) tax rate and
thresholds and index thresholds](ptaxes3.json)
