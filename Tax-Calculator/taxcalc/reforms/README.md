This directory contains examples of tax reform provisions that can be
combined and modified to construct tax reform proposals stored in text
files on your local computer.

Such reform proposals can then be uploaded to the [TaxBrain
webapp](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/) (or used on your local
computer) to estimate reform effects.

[This document](REFORMS.md) provides access to the reform proposals
that are currently available.
