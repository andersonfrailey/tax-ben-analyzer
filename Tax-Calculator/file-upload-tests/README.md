## Cross-Checking Results from Tax-Calculator

The contents of this directory are for use by the core development
team only.

The purpose of the cross-checking is to test that Tax-Calculator
produces essentially the same results when accessed in two different
ways: (1) via the Tax-Calculator command-line interface (CLI) `tc`
running on a local computer and (2) via the [TaxBrain file-upload web
page](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/).

The contents of this directory include JSON reform and assumption
files used in the cross-checking.  The local-computer results are
generated by the `cli-results` bash script in this directory.

The TaxBrain results are located at `http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/RUN`
where `RUN` is the number of the TaxBrain run.

The latest cross-checking results are shown below.  These results were
generated using Tax-Calculator PR#1253 (2017-03-21) and TaxBrain
version 0.7.9.  In the future these results will be generated with
both `tc` and TaxBrain using the same version of Tax-Calculator.

### Results for Tax-Calculator version 0.7.9 are as follows:

#### Reform `r1.json` with assumptions `a0.json`
```
              Tax-Calculator CLI   TaxBrain RUN
2022 INCOME TAX ($B)     1817.32   ????.?   TaxBrain is broken
